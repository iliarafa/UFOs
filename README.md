# UFOs

### Project Purpose 
This project aims to create a webpage featuring a dynamic table to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

### Results
This webpage features a very simple and user friendly interface to specify the given search criteria. Five filters are in place. By default the table is populated with our initial set of data. The process is as follows : 

#### _narrowing down the search: 
**Step 1**: Enter value in desired field. \
**Step 2**: Hit return OR move to the next field. Both actions display the updated filtered table. \
**Step 3**: Enter value in next field and repeat the process in Step 2. 


#### _broadening the search: 
**Step 1**: Backspace on the field you want to remove until you reach the placeholder value. \
**Step 2**: Hit Return, click on any point of the page's body, or move to the next field. 

### Summary 
Due to our data file's current structure we face a serious drawback that may affect the functionality of the page. The date format cannot be easily specified.
